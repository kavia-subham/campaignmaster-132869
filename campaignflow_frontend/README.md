# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors and Design System

All theme variables are centralized in `src/styles/variables.css`. The app is dark-first by default and supports toggling to light mode via the `useTheme` hook.

Primary tokens:
- `--primary: #1976d2`
- `--secondary: #ff9800`
- `--accent: #4caf50`

Reusable styles live in:
- `src/styles/components.css` (buttons, cards, inputs, badges, nav-items)
- `src/styles/utilities.css` (flex/grid, spacing, typography helpers)

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. Component and utility styles are imported via `src/index.css`.
